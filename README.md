- 👋 Hi, I’m @devinatkin. I'm a PhD Student at the University of Calgary. My research is into CMOS Image Sensors, specifically aiming for a combination of high speed and wide dynamic range performance. I've worked in a plethora of different programming languages and keep deciding on new ones to add to my list.
- 👀 I’m interested in VLSI, PCB Design, and Web Development. I'm interested in trying my hands at PCBHDL which I think offers some definitive advantages for AI optimized circuitry and parameterized circuit design. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... A lot of different topics. I lean heavily towards hardware; however, I'm learning more software every day. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analog circuits, fpga design, and chip design. I'm a huge fan of the work that's been happening with Open Source silicon and I predict the return of more specialized silicon for specific tasks. 
- 📫 Reach out to me via email or even other forms of messenger. I'm sorry to say that I'm attrociously slow to respond, don't be offended my own Mother sometimes has to wait a week to hear back from me.
